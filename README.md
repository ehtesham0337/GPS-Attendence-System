# GPS-Attendence-System

#### A GPS attendance system with the frontend built with React.js & Mantine UI, and backend implemented with Django.

There are two intended users of the application: Attendees and Organizers. The user of a system can have multiple events, each of which can have multiple slots. Attendees and Organizers can use it to join and view events in the form of tiles and mark their attendence when the timer is on. 

An attendee can use the system to check their attendance ratio in an event, and mark the attendance when a slot is open.

An organizer can use it to see all the participants of an event, which attendees marked present at a slot, the ratio of all the attendees of an event, and an option to manually mark the attendance of an attendee.

Google's Geolocation API has been used to retrieve the coordinates.
